## Background

Many groups need to track metadata across an organization.  The idea
of this little repository is to develop a standard file that is:

- Machine readable and writeable
- Human readable and writeable
- Extensible
- Simple

## Suggested use of the repository

The idea of using a GitHub repository is to capture ideas and develop a
straw man file format and documentation to meet the requirements described
in the Background section.

- Use github issues (and not email) to discuss ideas
- As issues are addressed, make changes to associated repository
files to implement the required changes

## Testing the YAML file

To test the parsing of the YAML file, simply run the little python script:

```
python testYAML.py
```
